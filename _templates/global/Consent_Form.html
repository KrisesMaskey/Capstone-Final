                    Welcome to this study in which you will do an activity with other anonymous participants online in real time. 
                    The study is led by Talal Rahwan, an associate professor of Computer Science at New York University Abu Dhabi.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Should you choose to participate, you will do the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Read and understand the rules </b>of the activity.</li>
                    <li><b>Answer comprehension check questions</b> to test your understanding of the rules. If you fail twice to 
                        correctly answer all questions, you will not be allowed to participate, but we will compensate you with 
                        ${{ failed_compensation }} for your time.
                    <li><b>Wait for the other participant</b> to join the activity.</li>
                    <li><b>Participate</b> in the activity.</li>
                    <li>Answer <b>follow up questions.</b></li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>
                    <b>You can only participate in this study if you are doing it from a computer</b>; the study is not designed for 
                    mobile devices, such as phones or tablets. <b>You need to do this study in a single sitting</b> as it involves real time interactions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You will receive a showup fee of ${{ showup_fee }} for completing the study, with the opportunity to earn more, depending on the choices 
                    that you and the other participant make during the activity. The other participants may be bots or people (other MTurk workers)
                    , and you will be informed of their nature before you participate in the activity. The maximum bonus you may earn in the activity 
                    is ${{ max_bonus }}, in addition to your showup fee.
                </p>

                <p><b>The estimated time for the activity is approximately {{ estimated_time }} minutes.</b></p>

                <p>
                    You will be placed in a waiting room, and the activity will start once the other participants have joined. 
                    If this doesn’t happen within {{ max_waiting_time }} minutes, you’ll receive the show-up fee. <br><br>

                    Participation in this study is voluntary and you may leave the study at any point. However, we can only pay you 
                    if you complete the study. We will keep track of your MTurk ID for payment and tracking. Information not containing 
                    identifiers may be used in future research or shared with other researchers without your additional consent.<br><br>

                    We do not anticipate any risks to you directly resulting from your participation in this study. There will also be
                    no benefits to you beyond the money you earn completing the study. However, you will be assisting in the 
                    collection of valuable data about human behavior. <br><br>
